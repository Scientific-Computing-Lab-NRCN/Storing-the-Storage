## NVRAM Memory Expansion
In this section of the work we evaluate the performances of Optane™ DCPMMT in Memory Mode for main memory expansion of scientific applications. To evaluate the usage of DCPMM devices as primary memory expansion, NPB and PolyBench benchmarks were executed on a single node of our experimental environment, with all its Optane™ DCPMMs configured in Memory Mode.

To compare these results with a traditional solution to the DRAM limits problem, these benchmarks 
were also executed on a configuration without Optane™ DCPMMs, but with memory swapping to a SATA-SSD device. 

The performances of NPB and PolyBench on our experimental system are given in *memory_expansion_results.xlsx*.
