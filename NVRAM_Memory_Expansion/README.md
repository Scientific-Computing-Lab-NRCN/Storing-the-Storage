## NVRAM Memory Expansion
In this section of the work we evaluate the performances of Optane™ DCPMMT for main memory expansion of scientific applications. To evaluate the usage of DCPMM devices as primary memory expansion, NPB and PolyBench benchmarks were executed on a single node of our experimental environment , with all its Optane™ DCPMMs configured in Memory Mode. \
The performances of NPB and PolyBench on our experimental system are given in *memory_expansion_results.xlsx*.
